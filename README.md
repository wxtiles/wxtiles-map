## wxtiles/wxtiles-map

A viewer for maps generated by [mapbuilder.wxtiles.com](http://mapbuilder.wxtiles.com), and an example client application of the [WXTiles](http://wxtiles.com/) API for tiled map layers.

`mapbuilder` generates static links to https://wxtiles.github.io/wxtiles-map/, with a `datums` URL parameter consisting of a base64-encoded JSON string. This allows static links to a custom map interface and prevents layers from being adjusted by anyone except the person who initially generated the map URL with `mapbuilder`. The information stored in this manner includes the active layers, their order, their opacity, and the map view. `wxtiles-map` makes dynamic requests to [api.wxtiles.com](https://api.wxtiles.com) using the map builder's supplied API key, ensuring that the most recent information is available for users (e.g. in an iframe). This repository is intended as a way to share views of up-to-date layers around, and also to serve as an example client of the WXTiles API.

### Running locally

`npm install && npm run js`

Copy a full path to `file:///../wxtiles-map/index.html` and paste it into your browser. But you'll also need to add a `?datums={base64-encoded-JSON}` URL parameter that you can obtain from `mapbuilder` in order for anything to be added to the interface.
